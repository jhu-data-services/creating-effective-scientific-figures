# Creating Effective Scientific Figures 
Slides and additional resources for the JHU Data Services Workshop on Creating Effective Scientific Figures
## General Resources

* [Nature Methods Methagora - Data Visualization Points of View Column](http://blogs.nature.com/methagora/2013/07/data-visualization-points-of-view.html): A must read series of blog posts on creating effective scientific figures. Much of this workshop's contents is derived from these posts, so they are worth reading in detail.

* [UT Austin - Design Strategies for Scientific Figures](https://cns.utexas.edu/images/CNS/Deans_Office/Communications/Files/design-tips-for-scientists_GUIDE.pdf):  An excellent short guide and checklist on ensuring your scientific figures are well designed.

* [Babraham Institute Bioinformatics Training Courses - Scientific Figure Design Workshop](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/training.html): A comprehensive tutorial on designing effective scientific figures (and a number of other computationally focused workshops) 

## Color

The role of color in data visualization is profound. Choosing the right colors for your data visualization is essential. Some considerations for appropriate color choice include accessibility (ensuring colors are distinguishable, even to those with colorblindness), perceptual uniformity, and format (will the colors be differentiable even when printed in grayscale).  

* [Practical Rules for Using Color in Charts](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/rules_for_using_color.pdf): Stephen Few offers an excellent guide on for choosing colors for data visualizations.

* [![Color Brewer](ColorBrewer.png)](http://www.colorbrewer2.org):  Arguably the most popular color palette generator is [ColorBrewer](http://www.colorbrewer2.org). ColorBrewer allows for the creation of colorblind safe, print friendly safe, and photocopy safe color palettes so your data visualizations will be accessible and usable to your entire audience. 

### Color in Scientific Visualization 

When working in scientific visualization, pseudocoloring 2D and 3D scalar fields, such as a topographical surface map, choice of color map is important. Color maps should change uniformly in brightness to indicate changes in value. The perceptual changes in commonly used color maps however, such as the rainbow color map ubiquitous in Matlab, do not abide by these rules. This leads to misleading interpretations of scientific figures. 

* [Color Map Advice for Scientific Visualization](https://www.kennethmoreland.com/color-advice/):  Kenneth Moreland, PhD at Sandia National Laboratories, offers some useful advice on choosing the appropriate color map for your scientific visualization.

## Image Processing Ethics

* [Digital Imaging: Ethics](http://microscopy.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/sites/default/files/upload/digital_image_ethics.pdf): A good guide on what is acceptable and what is not regarding digitial image manipulation in scientific imaging.
